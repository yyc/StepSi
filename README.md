# StepSi
A Step Simulator for the Actxa Stride.
This initiates a man-in-the-middle or Replay attack that will simulate a GATT device (the Actxa Stride), and report any arbitrary number of steps.

## System Requirements
This depends on gattacker, which requires a linux device (Raspberry Pis are fine) with a bluez-compatible bluetooth adapter.
